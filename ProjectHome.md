[Frex](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nf.frex.android) is an app for Android mobile devices. It allows users to easily create high quality fractal images. The generated images can be used as wallpaper and shared with other Frex users.

Frex (>= version 1.2) can now open Frex files from the FrexExamples page.
